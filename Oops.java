        // You can implement classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. here.

        //oops concepts in Java include:
        // 1. Classes and Objects - the fundamental building blocks of OOP.
        // 2. Inheritance - allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class.
        // 3. Polymorphism - the ability to present the same interface for different data types.
        // 4. Encapsulation - the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, typically a class.
        // 5. Abstraction - hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
        // 6. Interfaces - a reference type in Java, similar to class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
        // 7. Method Overloading and Overriding - method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
        // 8. Constructors - special methods used to initialize objects.
        // 9. Static and Non-static members - 
        // 10. Access Modifiers (public, private, protected) - 
        // 11. Inner Classes
        // 12. Anonymous Classes
        // 13. Abstract Classes and Methods
        // 14. Final Classes and Methods
        // 15. Exception Handling in OOP context
        // 16. Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)
        // This is a placeholder for OOP concepts in Java.
