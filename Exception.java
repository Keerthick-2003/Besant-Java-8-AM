//what is exception in java
// An exception in Java is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution
// and occurs when an unexpected situation arises, such as an error in the code or an issue with input/output operations.
// Exceptions can be handled using try-catch blocks to prevent the program from crashing and to provide a way to gracefully handle errors.
// checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.


public class Exception {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
